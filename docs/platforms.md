# Platforms and integrations

> Choose where to run Claude Code and what to connect it to. Compare the CLI, Desktop, VS Code, JetBrains, web, mobile, and integrations like Chrome, Slack, and CI/CD.

Claude Code runs the same underlying engine everywhere, but each surface is tuned for a different way of working. This page helps you pick the right platform for your workflow and connect the tools you already use.

## Where to run Claude Code

Choose a platform based on how you like to work and where your project lives.

| Platform                          | Best for                                                                                           | What you get                                                                                                                                                                              |

The CLI is the most complete surface for terminal-native work: scripting and the Agent SDK are CLI-only. Third-party providers also work in [VS Code](./vs-code.md#use-third-party-providers). Enterprise [Desktop](./desktop.md) deployments support Google Cloud's Agent Platform and gateway providers; for Amazon Bedrock or Microsoft Foundry, use the CLI or VS Code, or [Claude Desktop on 3P](https://claude.com/docs/third-party/claude-desktop/overview), which runs the Code tab on those providers. Desktop and the IDE extensions trade some CLI-only features for visual review and tighter editor integration. The web runs in Anthropic's cloud, so tasks keep going after you disconnect. Mobile is a thin client into those same cloud sessions or into a local session via Remote Control, and can send tasks to Desktop with Dispatch.

You can mix surfaces on the same project. Configuration, project memory, and MCP servers are shared across the local surfaces.

## Connect your tools

Integrations let Claude work with services outside your codebase.

## Work when you are away from your terminal

Claude Code offers several ways to work when you're not at your terminal. They differ in what triggers the work, where Claude runs, and how much you need to set up.

|                                                | Trigger                                                                                        | Claude runs on                                                                               | Setup                                                                                                                                | Best for                                                      |

If you're not sure where to start, [install the CLI](./quickstart.md) and run it in a project directory. If you'd rather not use a terminal, [Desktop](./desktop-quickstart.md) gives you the same engine with a graphical interface.
